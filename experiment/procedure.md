Step 1: Placing of the Furnace
- Drag the Furnace from the tools.
- Right click on the furnace and click on pin.

Step 2: Heating of the sample in the Furnace.
- Right click on the sample and drag it close to the furnace.
- Now, place the sample on the machine & click on pin.
- Keep all the solutionized samples in the furnace for aging at 120 deg C
- You can adjust zoom level also (Via Mouse Wheel).

Step 3: Hardness Testing of the sample in Vickers.
- Right click on the chamber of Furnace presented in the middle to unload the sample.
- Now, place the sample on the Vickers & click on pin.
- You can adjust zoom level also (Via Mouse Wheel).

Step 4: Observation Of Indent impressions of Al alloy age hardened at different durations.
- Perform d1 & d2 measurement from indent impressions of Al alloy.

Step 5: Plot the graph.
- Click below buttons to start the machine.
- Test1 for 466.8 gf load at 120 deg C

Step 6: Results
Aging curve of aluminum alloy at 120â„ƒ
- Peak-hardness = 177 HV

Step 7: Activity.
