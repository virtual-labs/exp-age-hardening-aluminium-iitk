For heat treatment, a furnace is required. For hardness measurement, a Vickers hardness tester is to be used. <br>

Precipitation-hardening, or age-hardening, is a very versatile method of strengthening certain metallic alloys. The aging treatment involves the precipitation of a series of metastable and stable precipitates out of a homogeneous, supersaturated solid solution. Various metastable structures offer different levels of resistance to dislocation motion leading to strengthening. One of the oldest precipitation hardenable aluminum alloy is Duralumin, which generally consists of alloying elements like copper, manganese, magnesium in aluminum.<br><br>
Fig. 1 shows the steps involved in the precipitation treatment for an aluminum alloy of composition Co. The steps are:<br>
	Solution Treatment: This involves heating the alloy to the single-phase region and maintaining it there for a sufficiently long time to dissolve any soluble precipitates. In the phase diagram, it involves heating at temperature To.<br>
	Quenching: This involves cooling the single-phase alloy very rapidly to room temperature or lower so that the formation of stable precipitates is avoided. Thus, one obtains a supersaturated solid solution. In this process, the sample has been quenched from To to T1.<br>
	Aging: This treatment consists of leaving the supersaturated solid solution at room temperature or at a slightly higher temperature (in the two-phase region). It results in the appearance of fine-scale precipitates. This involves heating to a temperature of T2. <br>
